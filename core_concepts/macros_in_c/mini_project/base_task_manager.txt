ðŸ”¹ Step 1: Base Task Manager
Requirements

    Define a struct Task with:

        int id

        char name[100]

        int completed (0 = not done, 1 = done).

Keep an array of tasks (limit 100 for now).

Menu:

    Add Task

    View Tasks

    Exit

Each new task gets an incremental ID (1, 2, 3...).
