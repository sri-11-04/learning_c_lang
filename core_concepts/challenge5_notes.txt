🧩 Challenge 5 — Student Database System
🎯 Goal

Create a simple program that manages student records — add, view, search, and save them permanently using file handling.

🧠 Description

You’ll design a menu-driven program that can:

Add new students → Input details and store them in a file.

Display all students → Read and print from file.

Search a student by roll number.

Delete all records (clear the file).

Exit → Safely close the program.

📋 Requirements

Define a structure to hold student details:

typedef struct {
    int roll;
    char name[50];
    float marks;
} Student;

Use a binary file (recommended) named "students.dat" for storage,
so that data persists even after the program exits.

⚙️ Menu Example

======= Student Database =======
1. Add Student
2. Display All Students
3. Search Student by Roll No
4. Delete All Records
5. Exit
--------------------------------
Enter your choice: 1

Each operation should call a function, e.g.:

void addStudent(FILE *file);
void displayStudents(FILE *file);
void searchStudent(FILE *file, int roll);
void deleteAllRecords(void);

🧩 File Handling Functions

Use:

fopen()

fwrite() return the count of the data written

fread() return the count of the data read

rewind()

fclose() return EOF if error in closing

remove() (for clearing the file) return 0 when the file removed

🧱 Core Logic Hints

Open file in “ab+” mode for adding/appending binary data.

After adding or searching, rewind(file) before reading again.

Use fwrite(&student, sizeof(Student), 1, file) and fread(&student, sizeof(Student), 1, file).

Handle file open errors properly.

✅ Sample Run

======= Student Database =======
1. Add Student
2. Display All Students
3. Search Student by Roll No
4. Delete All Records
5. Exit
--------------------------------
Enter your choice: 1

Enter Roll No: 101
Enter Name: Alice
Enter Marks: 89.5
✅ Student record added successfully!

Enter your choice: 2
Roll: 101  |  Name: Alice  |  Marks: 89.50

Enter your choice: 3
Enter Roll No to search: 101
Found: Roll: 101  |  Name: Alice  |  Marks: 89.50

Enter your choice: 4
⚠️ All records deleted successfully!

💡 Bonus Ideas (optional after base version works)

Add “Update Student by Roll No”.

Add “Sort by Marks”.

Store N students at once (read/write arrays of structs).

Write to text file too for human-readable reports.
