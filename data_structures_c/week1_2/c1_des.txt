🧩 Challenge 1 — Build Your First Singly Linked List
🎯 Goal

Build a basic singly linked list manually — using struct, malloc, and pointers — and print all node values in order.

This will help you understand how dynamic memory allocation and pointer linking create flexible data structures.

🧱 Concept (Hidden Learning)

You’ll secretly learn:

How to create custom data structures using struct

How nodes connect using pointers

How traversal works in a linked list (step-by-step pointer movement)

📋 Requirements

Define a struct Node that has:

int data → stores the value

struct Node *next → pointer to next node

Create 3 nodes manually using malloc.

Assign values (e.g., 10, 20, 30).

Link them together:

head → node1 → node2 → node3 → NULL


Write a function printList(struct Node *head)
→ Traverse and print values until NULL is reached.

🧠 Expected Output
Linked List: 10 -> 20 -> 30 -> NULL

💡 Hints

You’ll need <stdio.h> and <stdlib.h>.

malloc returns a void* → cast it to (struct Node*).

Don’t forget to set the next of the last node to NULL.

You can traverse using a temporary pointer, e.g.:

struct Node* temp = head;
while (temp != NULL) {
    printf("%d -> ", temp->data);
    temp = temp->next;
}


🧰 Bonus (Optional)

After it works:

Add a 4th node without changing other code.

Try changing the data type of data from int to char or float and observe.
