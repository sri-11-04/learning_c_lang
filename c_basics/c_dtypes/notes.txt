🔹 Standard Arithmetic Types

Integer types

char, signed char, unsigned char

short, unsigned short

int, unsigned int

long, unsigned long

long long, unsigned long long

Floating-point types

float

double

long double (higher precision, implementation dependent)

Boolean type (C99)

_Bool (with <stdbool.h> → bool, true, false)

🔹 Derived Types

These are built from the standard ones:

Pointers (int *p;)

Arrays (int arr[10];)

Functions (int func(void);)

Structures (struct Point { int x, y; };)

Unions (union Data { int i; float f; };)

Enumerations (enum Color { RED, GREEN, BLUE };)

🔹 Special Types

void → “no type” (used for functions with no return or pointers to unknown type).

Typedef (not a new type, but lets you create aliases).

⚠️ In modern C, you’ll mostly deal with:

int, long long, unsigned long long

float, double, long double

bool

Pointers, arrays, structs
