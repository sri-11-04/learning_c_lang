/* 
ðŸ”¹ Challenge: Employee Records with Department

ðŸ‘‰ Create a program that:

Defines two structs:

Department â†’ dept_id, dept_name

Employee â†’ emp_id, name, salary, and a Department (embedded struct, not pointer).

Reads details of 3 employees from the user.

Prints all employees, grouped by department (employees in the same department should appear together).

ðŸ“Œ Example Input

Enter Employee 1 details:
ID: 101
Name: Alice
Salary: 50000
Dept ID: 1
Dept Name: HR

Enter Employee 2 details:
ID: 102
Name: Bob
Salary: 60000
Dept ID: 2
Dept Name: IT

Enter Employee 3 details:
ID: 103
Name: Charlie
Salary: 55000
Dept ID: 1
Dept Name: HR

ðŸ“Œ Example Output
--- Department: HR ---
ID: 101, Name: Alice, Salary: 50000.00
ID: 103, Name: Charlie, Salary: 55000.00

--- Department: IT ---
ID: 102, Name: Bob, Salary: 60000.00

âš¡ Hints:
    Use struct inside struct (no pointers for now).
    After input, youâ€™ll need to group by dept_id before printing.
    You can do this by scanning employees and printing those that match the department.
