ðŸ”¹ Why do we use operators?

Operators let you manipulate data:

do math (+ - * / %)

compare values (== != > <)

make decisions (&& || !)

work at the bit level (& | ^ << >>)

assign values (= += -= etc.)

access memory or structures (* & -> .)

Without them, youâ€™d have to write functions for even basic arithmetic or comparisons!

ðŸ”¹ Categories of Operators in C
1. Arithmetic Operators => Used for math operations.
2. Relational (Comparison) Operators => Used in conditions (returns true/false â†’ 1 or 0).
3. Logical Operators => Combine conditions (used a lot in if statements).
4. Bitwise Operators => Operate bit by bit. Very powerful in low-level programming.
5. Assignment Operators => Assign and update variables.
6. Increment & Decrement
7. Conditional (Ternary) Operator => Short form of if-else
8. Comma Operator => Evaluates multiple expressions, result is the last one.
9. Sizeof Operator => Gives size of a data type or variable in bytes.
10. Pointer Operators
11. Structure Operators
12. Type Casting Operators

âœ… Thatâ€™s the overview of all operators in C.
Some are simple (arithmetic), some are tricky but powerful (bitwise, pointer, comma).
